# Scup!
Made by dk865

_Scup_ (cogwheel) is a fun, very simple, but terminal based game where you need to select one of 3 cups, attempting to find the one with the coins under it.

## Scup v1.0.1
Currently only supports Windows, as a batch file. Planning to work on a linux version! (Halfway there! Just need to fix the cups looking funky due to weird spaces.)
