# Scup!
Made by dk865

_Scup_ is a fun, but very simple game where you need to select one of 3 cups, attempting to find the one with the coins under it.

### If you would prefer, the Terminal Version for Windows is [here.](https://github.com/dk865/scup/tree/cogwheel)

## Helical Scup v1.0
*Currently* supports _Windows_ only, but, as soon as I find out how to use pyinstaller or some other tool that can build it for linux, it is a go! (less then a month for release, hopefully)
