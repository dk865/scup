# Scup!
Made by dk865

_Scup_ is a fun, but very simple game where you need to select one of 3 cups, attempting to find the one with the coins under it.


# Scup v1.0
*Currently* supports _Windows_ only, but, as soon as I find out how to use pyinstaller or some other tool that can build it for linux, it is a go! (less then a month for release, hopefully)

# Scup Terminal v1.0.1
Currently only supports Windows, as a batch file. Planning to work on a linux version! (Halfway there! Just need to fix the cups looking funky due to weird spaces.) (:
